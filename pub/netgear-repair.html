<h1 class="title">Automated Repair of Exploits in NETGEAR Router Binary</h1>
<p>
The speed with which researchers and vendors respond to security
vulnerabilities is critical, especially after exploits have been
discovered.  The situation is especially dire for end users who lack
product source code and typically must wait for a patch to be released
by the vendor.  We propose an alternative approach in which newly
discovered exploits drive an automated repair technique capable of
patching vulnerabilities, even without access to source code or
special information from the software vendor.
</p>

<p>
The repair method uses evolutionary computation to search for patches.
Extensions to earlier work include: Repairing security vulnerabilities
in router binaries; special processing to handle stripped ELF files;
operating without fault localization information; and operating
without a pre-existing regression test suite to define required
program behavior.
</p>

<p>
We demonstrate the method by repairing two recently discovered
exploits in version 4 of NETGEAR's WNDR3700 wireless router <i>before</i>
NETGEAR released patches publicly for the exploits.  Without the
advantage of regression tests to guide the search, we find that 80% of
repairs of the example exploits retain program functionality.  When a
few user-created tests of required functionality are incorporated in
an interactive process, success increases to 100% of the proposed
repairs.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Router bugs are a significant issue, ranging from the bug in CISCO's
IOS, which on February 16th caused outages in nearly every country
worldwide [<a href="#biggest-router-bug">45</a>], to security vulnerabilities in home
routers like NEGEAR [<a href="#zcutlip">10</a>] or the recent D-Link bug [<a href="#d-link">11</a>].
Security bugs are particularly problematic, especially because major
software vendors commonly delay releasing patches to security
exploits.  In a study of high and medium risk vulnerabilities in
Microsoft and Apple products between 2002 and 2008, for example, about
10% of vulnerabilities were found not to be patched within 150 days
of disclosure, and on any given date about 10 vulnerabilities and over
20 vulnerabilities were public and un-patched for Microsoft and Apple
respectively [<a href="#frei20080">13</a>].
</p>

<p>
Rather than waiting for vendor-delivered patches, we propose to repair
reproducible exploits automatically, even when developer source code
and test suites are not available.  A user-produced patch could be
installed temporarily for internal protection, redistributed with the
exploit (reporting an exploit with a patch in hand has been shown to
reduce the total number of attacks [<a href="#arora2006does">1</a>]), or sent to the
software vendor to reduce development time for the official patch
[<a href="#weimer06">41</a>].
</p>

<p>
In recent years, a variety of automated methods for program repair
have successfully repaired defects in real software (e.g.,
[<a href="#clearview">33</a>,<a href="#genprog-tse-journal">25</a>,<a href="#par">21</a>,<a href="#nguyen2013semfix">32</a>]).  Automated repair methods based on
evolutionary computation (EC) have also repaired defects directly in
x86 and ARM ELF files, without access to program source code
[<a href="#schulte2013embedded">36</a>].  This prior work, however, relies on a
regression test suite to define the required functionality, or
informal specification, of the program under repair.  Here we consider
a setting in which neither source code nor test suites are available,
and there is no special information or cooperation from the vendor.
</p>

<p>
We demonstrate our technique by patching multiple security
vulnerabilities in the popular NETGEAR WNDR3700 wireless router, which
at the time of submission NETGEAR has not publicly addressed.
Although previous EC-based program repair techniques explicitly
require access to a regression test suite, we explore the feasibility
of performing repairs without any such test suite and find that for
our example exploits, regression test suites are most often not
necessary. In addition, we find that the complexity of security
vulnerabilities requires iterative applications of repair edits within
a single evolutionary run.
</p>

<p>
The main  contributions of this short paper are;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A novel technique suitable for automatically generating security
repairs in routers without access to source code, regression test
suites, or fault localization information; and
</li>
<li>An application of the approach to a real-world unpatched security
exploit, resulting in
</li>
<li>The first demonstration of multiple iterative repairs in a single
run of the evolutionary repair algorithm.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To encourage reproducible research [<a href="#buckheit1995wavelab">5</a>,<a href="#mesirov2010accessible">30</a>] and to allow others to patch future
exploits, we have published a companion open source repository <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
It contains the instructions, source code, and tooling needed to
extract, execute and repair the binary NETGEAR router image
vulnerabilities, as well as the data used to generate the analyses and
figures reported in this paper.
</p>

<p>
We hope that this work encourages users to patch important
vulnerabilities quickly and researchers to release patches
simultaneously with exploit announcements.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the paper reviews two recent exploits of NETGEAR
WNDR3700 (Section <a href="#exploits">2</a>); demonstrates % the feasibility of
running the NETGEAR firmware in a VM sandbox (Section <a href="#sandbox">3.1</a>);
describes the automated program repair technique (Sections <a href="#elf">3.2</a> and
<a href="#on-demand-regression">3.3</a>); evaluates effectiveness and quality of repairs
(Section <a href="#repair-demonstration">4</a>); summarizes related work (Section
<a href="#related-work">5</a>); and discusses implications and limitations (Section

<h2 id="exploits"><a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Description of Exploits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-exploits">
<p>
We describe two current exploits in version 4 of the NETGEAR WNDR3700
wireless router. The popularity of this router implies that vulnerable
systems are currently widespread. For example, the "shodan" <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
device search engine returned hundreds of vulnerable publicly
accessible WNDR3700 routers at the time of writing.  Both exploits
exist in the router's internal web server in a binary executable named
<code>net-cgi</code>, and both are related to how <code>net-cgi</code> handles
authentication [<a href="#zcutlip">10</a>].
</p>

<p>
The vendor-deployed binary is insecure in at least two ways: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any URI starting with the string "BRS" bypasses authentication.
</li>
<li>Any URI including the substring "<code>unauth.cgi</code>" or
"<code>securityquestions.cgi</code>" bypass authentication. This applies even
to requests of the form <a href="http://router/page.html?foo=unauth.cgi">http://router/page.html?foo=unauth.cgi</a>,
meaning that the vulnerability effectively applies to all internal
webpages.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many administrative pages start with the "<code>BRS</code>" string, providing
attackers with access to personal information such as users passwords,
and by accessing the page <a href="http://router/BRS_02_genieHelp.html">http://router/BRS_02_genieHelp.html</a>
attackers can disable authentication completely and permanently across
reboots.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Automated Repair Method</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Our repair technique for this vulnerability consists of three stages:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Extract the binary executable from the firmware and reproduce the
exploit (Section <a href="#sandbox">3.1</a>).
</li>
<li>Use EC to search for repairs by applying random mutations (and
crossover) to the stripped (without symbols or section tables) MIPS
ELF binary (Section <a href="#elf">3.2</a>).
</li>
<li>Construct test cases lazily, as needed, to improve the quality of
unsatisfactory candidate repairs (Section <a href="#on-demand-regression">3.3</a>).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first step in repairing the <code>net-cgi</code> executable is to
extract it and the router file system from the firmware image
distributed by NETGEAR.  Using the extracted files ystem and
executable we construct a test harness that can exercise the exploits
in <code>net-cgi</code>.  This test harness is used by the repair
algorithm to evaluate candidate repairs and to identify when repairs
to the exploits have been found.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sandbox" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sandbox"><a id="sec-3-1" name="sec-3-1"></a><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Firmware Extraction and Virtualization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sandbox">
<p>
NETGEAR distributes firmware with a full system image for the WNDR3700
router, which includes the router file system that has the vulnerable
<code>net-cgi</code> executable.  The file system was extracted using the
<code>binwalk</code> <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> firmware extraction tool, which scans the binary data
in the raw monolothic firmware file, searching for signatures
identifying embedded data sections, including <code>squashfs</code>
[<a href="#lougher2006squashfs">28</a>] that hold the router's file system.
</p>

<p>
The router runs on a big-endian MIPS architecture, requiring emulation
on most desktop system to safely reproduce the exploit and evaluate
candidate repairs. We used the QEMU system emulator
[<a href="#bellard2005qemu">3</a>] to emulate the MIPS architecture in a lightweight
manner with Debian Linux also run in emulation.  The extracted router
file system is copied into the emulated MIPS Linux system.  A number
of special directories (e.g., <code>/proc/</code>, <code>/dev/</code> etc.) are mounted
inside the extracted file system and bound to the corresponding
directories on the virtual machine.  At this point, commands can be
executed in an environment that closely approximates the execution
environment of the NETGEAR router by using the <code>chroot</code> command to
confine executable access to within the extracted NETGEAR file
system. Additional minor adjustments are described in
<a href="http://eschulte.github.io/netgear-repair/INSTRUCTIONS.html">http://eschulte.github.io/netgear-repair/INSTRUCTIONS.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
At this point the NETGEAR router can be run under virtualization.  In
particular, the router's web interface can be accessed either using an
external web browser or the <code>net-cgi</code> executable can be called
directly from the command line.

<div id="outline-container-elf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="elf"><a id="sec-3-2" name="sec-3-2"></a><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Automated Program Repair and ELF Files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-elf">
<p>
We use EC methods [<a href="#forrest2009genetic">12</a>,<a href="#genprog-tse-journal">25</a>,<a href="#le2012representations">26</a>,<a href="#legoues2011systematicstudy">14</a>] to search
for small changes to existing programs that eliminate undesired buggy
behavior.  This process typically has access to the source code of the
original program, which is first transformed into an abstract syntax
tree and then iteratively modified using random <i>mutations</i> and
<i>crossovers</i> to generate program variants.  Each variant is evaluated
in a process called fitness evaluation by running it against the
program's existing regression test suite and at least one additional
test that demonstrates the undesired behavior.
</p>

<p>
The repair algorithm constructs a population of 512 program variants,
each with one or more random mutations.  This population is evolved
through an iterated process of evaluation, selection, mutation, and
crossover (pseudo-code and Figure <a href="#mutation-ops">2</a>) until a version of the
original program is found that repairs the bug.  'Repair' in this
context is defined to mean that it avoids the buggy behavior and does
not break required functionality.  In earlier versions of the
algorithm, execution traces were collected during program execution
and used as a form of <i>fault localization</i> to bias random mutations
towards the parts of the program most likely to contain the bug.  Our
decision not to use fault localization is explained in Section
<a href="#no-fault-localization">4.2.2</a>.
</p>

<p>
This basic repair algorithm was modified in several ways to address
the unique scenario of a user repairing a faulty binary executable
(Section <i>#mutate-mips</i>), without access to a regression test suite
(Section <a href="#on-demand-regression">3.3</a>), and without the fault localization
optimization.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-1">
<p>
Executable programs for Unix and embedded system are commonly
distributed as ELF (Executable and Linking Format) [<a href="#tis1995tool">7</a>]
files.  Each ELF file contains a number of headers and tables
containing administrative data, and sections holding program code and
data.  The three main administrative elements of an ELF file are the
ELF header, the section table and the program table (see Figure <a href="#elf">1</a>).
The ELF header points to the section table and the program table, the
section table holds information on the layout of sections in the ELF
file on disk, and the program table holds information on how to copy
sections from disk into memory for program execution.
</p>


<div id="elf" class="figure">
<p><img src="elf-layout.svg" alt="elf-layout.svg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Sections and their uses in an Executable and Linking Format (ELF) file.</p>
</div>

<p>
Although the majority of ELF files include all three of the elements
shown in Figure <a href="#elf">1</a>, only the ELF Header is guaranteed to exist in all
cases.  In executable ELF files, the program table is also required,
and similarly, in linkable files the section table is required.
</p>

<p>
We extend previous work that repaired unstripped Intel and ARM files
[<a href="#schulte2013embedded">36</a>].  The ELF file is modfied by the mutation and
crossover operations, but in this case <code>net-cgi</code> does not include key
information on which the earlier work relied, namely the section table
and section name string table.  This information was used to locate
the <code>.text</code> section of the ELF file where program code is normally
stored.  The data in the <code>.text</code> section were then coerced into a
linear array of assembly instructions (the <i>genome</i>) on which the
mutation operations were defined.  Our extension removes this
dependence by concatenating the data of every section in the program
table that has a "loadable" type to produce the genome.  These are the
sections whose data are loaded into memory during program execution.
</p>

<p>
Mutation operations must change program data without corrupting the
structure of the file or breaking the many addresses hard coded into
the program data itself (e.g., as destinations for conditional jumps).
In general, it is impossible to distinguish between an integer literal
and an address in program data, so the mutation operations are
designed to preserve operand absolute sizes and offsets within the ELF
program data.  This requirement is easily met because every argumented
assembly instruction in the MIPS RISC architecture is one word long
[<a href="#hennessy1982mips">17</a>].  "Single point crossover" is used to
recombine two ELF files.  An offset in the program data is selected,
then bytes from one file are taken up to that offset and bytes from
the other file taken after that offset.  This form of crossover works
especially well because all ELF files will have similar total length
and offsets. The mutation and crossover operations used to modify
stripped MIPS ELF files are shown in Figure <a href="#mutation-ops">2</a>.
</p>


<div id="mutation-ops" class="figure">
<p><img src="mut-ops.svg" alt="mut-ops.svg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Mutation and Crossover operations for stripped MIPS ELF files.  The program data are represented as a fixed length array of single-word sections.  These operators change these sections maintaining length and offset in the array.</p>

<h3 id="on-demand-regression"><a id="sec-3-3" name="sec-3-3"></a><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> On-Demand Regression Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-on-demand-regression">
<p>
Our approach to program repair relies on the ability to assess the
validity of any candidate repair.  The mutations are random in the
sense that they do not take into account or preserve the semantics of
the program.  They are more likely to create new bugs or exploits than
they are to repair undesired behavior, and the method requires an
evaluation scheme to distinguish between these cases.
</p>

<p>
Instead of relying on a pre-existing regression test suite, we assume
only that a demonstration of the exploit provides a single available
test.  By mutating programs without the safety net of a regression
test suite, the evolved "repairs" often introduce significant
regressions.  However, by applying a strict minimization process after
the primary repair is identified, these regressions are usually
removed (Section <a href="#minimization">4.2.3</a>).  The minimization reduces the
difference between the evolved repair and the original program to as
few edits as possible using Delta Debugging [<a href="#delta">44</a>].  The
interactive phase of the repair algorithm asks the user to identify
any regressions that remain after the Delta Debugging step.
High-level pseudocode for the repair algorithm is show in Figure
<a href="#lazy-algorithm">1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our method is thus an interactive repair process in which the
algorithm searches for a patch that passes every available test
(starting with only the exploit), and then minimizes it using Delta
Debugging.  In a third step, the user evaluates its suitability.  If
the repair is accepted, the process terminates. Otherwise, the user
supplies a new regression test that the repair fails (a witness to its
unsuitability) and the process repeats.  In Section
<a href="#repair-demonstration">4</a> we find that 80% of our attempts to repair the
NETGEAR WNDR3700 exploits did not require any user-written regression
tests.
</p>

<p>
The <code>evolutionarySubroutine</code> in Figure <a href="#lazy-algorithm">1</a> is organized
similarly to previous work [<a href="#genprog-tse-journal">25</a>], but it uses a
<i>steady state</i> evolutionary computational algorithm
[<a href="#Luke2013Metaheuristics">29</a>] for reduced memory usage and ease of
parallelization of fitness evaluation.  Figure <a href="#evolutionary-subroutine">2</a>
gives the high-level pseudocode.
</p>

<p>
Note that every time the user rejects the solution returned by
<code>evolutionarySubroutine</code>, the evolved and minimized solution is
discarded and a new population is generated by recopying the original
in <code>evolutionarySubroutine</code>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-repair-demonstration">
<p>
We first describe the experimental setup used to test the repair
technique on the NETGEAR WNDR3700 exploit (Section <a href="#methodology">4.1</a>).  We
then analyze the results of ten repair attempts (Section <a href="#analysis">4.2</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-methodology">
<p>
All repairs were performed on a server-class machine with 32 physical
Intel Xeon 2.60GHz cores, Hyper-Threading and 120 GB of Memory. We
used a test harness to assess the fitness of each program variant
(Section <a href="#fitness-evaluation">4.1.1</a>) and report parameters used in the
experiments (Section <a href="#parameters">4.1.2</a>}).
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="fitness-evaluation"><a id="sec-4-1-1" name="sec-4-1-1"></a><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Fitness Evaluation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-fitness-evaluation">
<p>
We used 32 QEMU virtual machines, each running Debian Linux with the
NETGEAR router firmware environment available inside of a <code>chroot</code>.
The repair algorithm uses 32 threads for parallel fitness evaluation.
Each thread is paired with a single QEMU VM on which it tests fitness.
</p>

<p>
The test framework includes both a host and a guest test script.  The
host script runs on the server performing repair and the guest script
runs in a MIPS virtual machine.  The host script copies a variant of
the <code>net-cgi</code> executable to the guest VM where the guest test script
executes <code>net-cgi</code> the command line and reports a result of <code>Pass</code>,
<code>Fail</code>, or <code>Error</code> for each test.  These values are then used to
calculate the variant's scalar fitness.
</p>

<p>
<code>Pass</code> indicates that the program completed successfully and produced
the correct result, <code>Fail</code> indicates that the program completed
successfully but produced an incorrect result, and <code>Error</code> indicates
that the program execution did not complete successfully due to early
termination (e.g., because of a segfault) or by a non-zero "errno"
exit value.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-parameters">
<p>
Repair used the following parameters.  The maximum population size was
512 individuals, selection is performed using a tournament size of
two <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.  When the population overflows the maximum population
size, an individual is selected for eviction using tournament
selection in reverse.  Newly generated individuals undergo crossover
two-thirds of the time.
</p>

<p>
These parameters differ significantly from those used in previous
evolutionary computation (EC) repair algorithms (e.g.,
[<a href="#forrest2009genetic">12</a>,<a href="#legoues2011systematicstudy">14</a>,<a href="#le2012representations">26</a>]).  Specifically, we use larger populations
(512 instead of 40 individuals), running for many more fitness
evaluations (&le;100,000 instead of &le;400).  However, the parameters used
here are in line with those used in other EC publications given the
size of the <code>net-cgi</code> binary, and they help compensate for the lack of
fault localization information.
</p>

<p>
The increased memory required by the larger population size is offset
by the use of a steady-state [<a href="#Luke2013Metaheuristics">29</a>] EC algorithm,
and the increased computational demand of the greater number of
fitness evaluations is offset by parallelization of fitness
evaluation.

We report results for the time typically taken to generate a repair
(Section <a href="#runtime">4.2.1</a>), the effect of eliminating fault localization
(Section <a href="#no-fault-localization">4.2.2</a>), and the impact of the minimization
process (Section <a href="#minimization">4.2.3</a>), both with respect to the size of the
repair in terms of byte difference from the original and in terms of
the fitness improvement.  Finally we demonstrate how multiple repairs
can be discovered iteratively by the repair process (Section
<a href="#iterative-repair">4.2.4</a>).

<p>
In 8 of the 10 runs of the algorithm (with random restarts), the three
exploit tests alone were sufficient to generate a satisfactory repair
(determined using a withheld regression test suite hand-written by the
authors <sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>), and the third phase of user-generated tests was not
required.
</p>

<p>
In these cases the repair process took an average of ~36,000 total fitness
evaluations requiring on average 86.6 minutes to find a repair using 32
virtual machines for parallelized fitness evaluation.

<p>
In the NETGEAR scenario, we do not have a regression test suite
available.  In addition, however, a regression test suite may
sometimes over-constrain the search operators (mutation and crossover)
[<a href="#schulte2013optimization">37</a>], preventing the discovery of valid
repairs.
</p>

<p>
One of the NETGEAR exploits exemplifies this issue.  As shown in
Figure <a href="#ts-cov-rt-w-min">3</a> , fault localization might have prevented the
repair process from succeeding.  The figure shows that many of the
program edit locations for successful repairs were not visited by the
execution trace.  In fact, only 2 of the 22 program locations modified
by successful repairs were within 3 instructions of the execution
traces.  Although surprising, this result suggests that earlier work,
which confines edit operations to execution traces, would likely be
unable to repair the NETGEAR bugs.

In some cases the initial suggested repair, known as the <i>primary</i>
repair, was not satisfactory.  For example, suggested repairs
sometimes worked when <code>net-cgi</code> was called directly on the command
line but not through the embedded uHTTPd webserver <sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>, or the
repaired file failed to serve pages not used in the exploit test.
However, Table <a href="#minimized-stats">1</a> shows that in most cases the minimized
version of the repair was satisfactory, successfully passing all
hand-written regression tests, even those not used during the repair
process.

As shown in Table <a href="#minimized-stats">1</a>, the initial evolved repair differed
from the original at over 200 locations on average in the ELF program
data, while the minimized repairs differed at only 1&#x2013;3 locations on
average.  This great discrepancy is due to the accumulation of
candidate edits in non-tested portions of the program data.  Since
these portions of the program were not tested, there was no
evolutionary pressure to purge the harmful edits.  Delta Debugging
eliminates these edits.

<p>
Evolutionary computation (EC) refers to the use of natural selection
as a search heuristic [<a href="#holland1992adaptation">18</a>,<a href="#koza1992genetic">22</a>].
EC techniques have been developed to operate directly on machine code
[<a href="#kuhling2002brute">24</a>], and more recently they have been applied to the
problem of software source-code repair [<a href="#genprog-tse-journal">25</a>],
optimization [<a href="#sitthi2011genetic">39</a>,<a href="#schulte2013optimization">37</a>], and
to repairing assembly code and binary ELF files
[<a href="#schulte2013embedded">36</a>].  In each of the repair scenarios, however,
the technique relies on regression tests to preserve required
functionality.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the EC methods mentioned above, Clearview
[<a href="#clearview">33</a>] automatically patches errors in running binaries by
learning invariants of running executables, and then reacting to
attacks or bugs that invalidate the invariants by applying predefined

<p>
The results presented here open up the possibility that end users
could repair software exploits in closed source software without
special information or aid from the software vendor.  
</p>

<p>
There are several caveats associated with this initial work.  First,
we demonstrated repair on a single executable, and it is possible that
the success in the absence of regression test suite will not
generalize.  However, our results do not appear to be based on any
property unique to the NETGEAR exploits.  We conjecture that our
success at finding functional repairs in this setting is due to the
beneficial impact of minimization and to a property of software known
as <i>mutational robustness</i> [<a href="#schulte2013software">38</a>].  Across a wide
variety of software, this work found that the functionality of
software mutants differs by only about 60% between software tested
with an empty regression test suites and software tested with the best
obtainable quality regression test suites.  A second caveat arises
from the fact that the NETGEAR exploit occured in a web interface
rather than actual routing routines.  Although security
vulnerabilities are serious wherever they occur, an important area for
future work is to explore repairs of other types of router bugs,
importantly concurrency bugs.  Finally, we demonstrated the repair
running in a virtualized environment and not natively in the router.
Although we did not test our repairs on physical NETGEAR WNDR3700
hardware, we are confident that our repairs would have the same effect
on hardware as they do in emulation.
</p>

<p>
Software defined networking (SDN) and dedicated network debuggers
[<a href="#handigol2012debugger">16</a>] point to a future in which network bugs are
more easily reproduced and tested.  In this case, there will likely be
increasing opportunity for techniques like the one presented here to
quickly patch important network bugs.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a patch is distributed there a risk of someone
reverse-engineering an exploit from the patch text
[<a href="#brumley2008automatic">4</a>].  As shown in Table <a href="#minimized-stats">1</a> our
technique sometimes generates patches that are not directly relevant
to the repaired exploit.  It may be possible to avoid this risk by
generating obfuscated patches in cases where a regression test suite
<i>is</i> available minimization is not performed.

<p>
The paper described a method that enables end users to repair
networking software without cooperation from the software vendor.  We
demonstrate the method by repairing two security vulnerabilities in
the popular NETGEAR WNDR3700 router, vulnerabilities that currently
exist in many actively used devices and have not been addressed by
NETGEAR.  Our method does not require access to source code or a
pre-existing regression test suite.

When the fitness of all variants in the population has been
evaluated, the fitness values are used to select one individual for
subsequent modifications in the next generation.  We use <i>tournament
selection</i> where each tournament chooses a subset of two (the
tournament size) randomly from the population and the individual
with higher fitness wins the tournament and is copied into the
population.
