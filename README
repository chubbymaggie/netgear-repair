        Automated Repair of Exploits in NETGEAR Router Binary

Version 4 of NETGEAR's WNDR3700 wireless router contains exploits
allowing unauthenticated users to change administrative options and
completely disable authentication across reboots (see [1]).

We fix these exploits using a method of automated program repair [2]
which operates directly on binary ELF files and requires no access to
source code.  This fix was found before NETGEAR addressed these
exploits---to my knowledge NETGEAR has not yet patched these exploits
in the latest release of the firmware 1.0.1.42 as of 2013-11-19.

This repository contains the instructions, code, and tooling used to
develop this repair.  These tools may be used to automatically change
the behavior other binary ELF executables, making it possible to fix
customize and alter binaries executables without any aid from the
software's developer.

A detailed description of the exploit and the repair technique and the
repairs found is available at [3] and step by step instructions to
reproduce this repair are given in INSTRUCTIONS.

Thanks to Zachary Cutlip for help reproducing these exploits in a VM.
